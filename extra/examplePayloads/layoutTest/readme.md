This payload is intended for testing keybard layout files.  
You should have some text editor open before inserting the  
device, and both PocketAdmin and target machine's GUI have  
to be configured for the same keyboard layout. In this example  
french layout is expected, so change it to your own. After  
you plug the device in, it should type a string just like in  
the script: `1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./  
~!@#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:"ZXCVBNM<>?  
  
If any characters are not typed like the script says, you  
need to modify the layout file.  
  
Note: on italian keyboard there is no way to input tilde and  
backtick symbols ( ~ and ` ), so spacebars are used instead.
